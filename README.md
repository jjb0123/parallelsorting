This is my final project for CS 358, where I parallelized various sorting algortihms.

The non-parallelized files were taken from Geeks for Geeks.

The benchmark script was partially written using Generative AI, when I had to port the code from Linux -> macOS and was struggling to figure out the .sh syntax in time.
